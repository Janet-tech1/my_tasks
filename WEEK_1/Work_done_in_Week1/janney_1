# Basic usage of print()
print("Hello, world!")
print("Welcome to Python programming.")

# Using print() with variables
name = "Janet"
age = 25
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
# Using f-strings with prints()
name = "Bola"
score = 92
print(f"{name} scored {score} in the exam.")
# Using string concatenation
first_name = "Ada"
last_name = "Lovelace"
print ("Full name: " + first_name + " " + last_name) 
# Comma vs concatenation
print("Hello", "world!")    # With comma
print("Hello" + " " + "world!")   # With concatenation
